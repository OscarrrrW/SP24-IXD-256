Assignment 02

This is a device for people running on the road at night, and the lights appear green when the user is not moving, and blue and red when the user is moving. The user can also adjust the flashing frequency of the light by rotating the button. Finally, there is a battery-like icon on the small screen that shows how fast the user is moving.
